- Open the app and show the chat list. This is the first impression so they see a clean layout, polished UI. We should let the design speak for itself.
- Tap into a chat and send a few messages back and forth. The key moment here: as the conversation progresses, the background shifts based on the tone/emotion of the exchange.
- Show how the AI is working under the hood to detect paralinguistic signals (tone, emotion, intent) and how that powers the background changes.(if possible)
- We need to show the overall smoothness so transitions, animations, load times everything should feel fluid.

I was trying to think what could be possible or not. I spent a couple of hours with Enis today to get that design to an "okay" stage

its not something I am super super pleased with yet but I needed to get something for you

What else do you think we can do with the demo? Whats possible to showcase now?

I kept it simple because I just want to highlight design, detection of mood, and smoothness

thats it. Just to show how intuitive it is
